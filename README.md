#__Tom Riley Star Wars Top Trumps v1__

##Getting started

1. install node modules
2. run "npm run watch" to build the project

```

##How it works

* Click a card on the splash page to choose a starting deck
* Then it will show which card has one based on the deck chosen
* Play again to compare two more cards
* Show Results to find out the results from selected cards


```

##Decisions

* I have used React, Typescript throughout
* I have used React Router for the different pages in the App
* Included use of React hook in the Trump Card component
* Styled website in generic format and some components. I haven't spent much time into design or UX.

##In Future

* Add GraphQL for the data queries in the game itself
* Finish the styling and make it more user friendly
* Add multi player and themes 
* Add animation to the cards and when playing again
